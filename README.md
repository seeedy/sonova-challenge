# Notes

- I've used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to start the project. While not necessary this website that doesn't contain any logic or state, I'm most familiar and quickest with the React workflow.
- I've used css-modules for the styling of components and few global styles in `./styles`

## Viewing the app

In the project directory, first run `yarn`to install modules and then `yarn start` to start dev mode and view the app on `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.

Use `yarn build` to build the production version to the `build` folder.
